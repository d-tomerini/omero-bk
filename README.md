# Front-end for the datalake landing zone

A FastAPI app to act as a backend for the landing zone
of the upcoming datalake.

The app provides a list of the metadata store, a way to update
and delete them, and a way to search and filter the data.

It will provide a list of the required metadata fields, their types
and other information to be able to upload and track them.
